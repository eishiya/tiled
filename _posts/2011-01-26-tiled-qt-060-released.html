<p>
    It's been more than half a year after the last major release, but meanwhile
    development of Tiled has continued as usual, as is evident by the many new
    features in this release. The improvements include support for multiple
    documents, initial support for object selection, support for placing tiles
    as objects and centering the map when it's smaller than the view.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    Of note is also the enhanced integration with MacOS X. The tmx file type is
    now recognised and associated with Tiled, allowing them to be opened from
    the Finder or by dragging them to the Tiled icon on the dock.
</p>
<p>
    There was a license change of the core classes of Tiled (those in libtiled),
    which are now BSD licensed. This should be convenient for those who wish to
    use those classes in their (Qt/C++) project. For Java projects, Tiled now
    ships with a libtiled-java, which is a somewhat cleaned up version of the
    core classes from Tiled Java. For both libraries there are simple tmx viewer
    applications that show how to use them.
</p>

<p>
    Finally I want to thank everybody who contributed to this release!
    Significant work was done by Stefan Beller on the multi-document support,
    improvements to the stamp tool, the quick stamps and the new automatic
    mapping feature. Jeff Bland helped to improve Tiled for MacOS X and added
    support for running arbitrary commands from Tiled. Bin Wu and Zhao Sting
    provided a Chinese translation and Tamir Atias translated Tiled to Hebrew
    (its first right-to-left language). Also thanks to all the translators who
    updated their translation!

    <b>Warning:</b> This version of Tiled changes the default compression method
    for layer data from <i>gzip</i> to <i>zlib</i>. The latter is more suitable
    for in-memory compression while gzip was meant for files. In most
    environments, zlib is easier to deal with (especially in C/C++, but also in
    Python). If your map reader does not support zlib, you can still tell Tiled
    to use gzip in the preferences.
