<p>
    Announcing a new release within a few weeks unfortunately ended up as not
    much more than an April Fools' joke. However, more than a year after our
    last release, Tiled 0.6.0 finally made it. It is probably our most stable
    release ever. New features include internationalization, stamp brush
    functionality, rewritten preferences code (no more tiled.conf) and a JSON
    export plugin. A small change was made to the map format. In all cases, the
    properties are now wrapped in a <i>properties</i> element.

        for easy copying
