This small upgrade is mandatory for anybody who's using the
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/Using-the-Terrain-Tool"
    >Terrain tool</a
>. It fixes a crash that was reported three times already since the 0.10.0
release. The full changelog:
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a crash that could happen when using the Terrain tool</li>
    <li>Fixed missing background color information from Lua export</li>
    <li>
        Allow using up to 3 or 4 GB RAM on 32 or 64 bit Windows systems
        respectively
    </li>
</ul>
In addition, there is now a
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/releases">64-bit Windows installer</a>
available, for those who need to edit crazy huge maps!
