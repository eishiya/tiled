>This second release of the Qt version of Tiled is mainly trying to catch up
with the Java version a bit, feature wise. Tiled Qt should now be fully usuable
as a replacement of the Java version for basic orthogonal tile maps. The
changes:<br />
<ul>
    <li>Added support for zooming the map view</li>
    <li>Added an eraser tool that allows you to erase tiles</li>
    <li>Added ability to save a map as an image</li>
    <li>Added support for masking tileset images based on a certain color</li>
    <li>Added a slider to change the opacity of the current layer</li>
    <li>Fixed the minimum row and column size in the tileset view</li>
    <li>Fixed stamp creation when not dragging topleft to bottomright</li>
</ul>
