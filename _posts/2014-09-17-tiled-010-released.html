<p>
    It took a very long time for me to get around to this release. In part
    because my spare time has gotten very limited, but it's also because there
    were constantly many new features to be added. Either from contributors via
    pull requests or for sponsors needing particular functionality. Both are
    very good and very welcome, but I will do my best not to let the next
    release become as big!
</p>
<p>
    In the UI the most visible change may be the new Properties dock, which
    should be a lot more pleasant to work with than the previous solution. A
    less obvious one bit still very useful is the support for writing
    import/export plugins in Python. I've written about both of these features
    in a
    <a
        href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-04-26-tiled-development-update %}"
        >previous post</a
    >.

    Finally, if you want to help out by giving me more time to maintain and
    develop Tiled, consider
    <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/donate">donating or becoming a sponsor</a

    reducing my work hours so that I can dedicate significant amount of time to
    Tiled and maybe even a successor. A big thanks to all who have already
    donated or are sponsoring Tiled, since you are making this possible!
