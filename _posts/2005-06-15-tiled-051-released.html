<p>
    Tiled 0.5.1 is certainly late, and thus a number of requests have built up
    while we've been busy with other projects. It is a step closer to the
    stability we hope to achieve, and it adds some of the features that have
    been asked for.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Added a checkerboard background to tileset palette</li>
    <li>Added support for layer locking (not editable when locked)</li>
    <li>Added support for tmx.gz map files</li>
    <li>
        Added selection addition and substraction via Shift and Ctrl
        respectively
    </li>
    <li>
        Improved the drawing speed thanks to some thorough testing and
        suggestions (Jerome Blouin)
    </li>
    <li>Improved transformation so that it respects selections</li>
    <li>Fixed the "Save As Image" feature to use current zoom level</li>
    <li>Fixed drawing on invisible layers</li>
    <li>Fixed selection rectangle to include one more tile</li>
    <li>Fixed loading of plugins that only do export and no import</li>
    <li>Fixed removing tilesets in the Tileset Manager</li>
    <li>
        Fixed image loading to ensure hardware acceleration is used where
        possible in Java 1.4 and above (Jerome Blouin)
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed a NullPointerException when loading TSX files as imported tilesets
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed an "Unsupported protocol" error when loading TMX files which
        referenced an external tileset under certain conditions
    </li>
    <li>Fixed a ClassCastException when loading GIFs as tilesets</li>
</ul>
