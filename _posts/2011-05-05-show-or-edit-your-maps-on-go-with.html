    A few days ago, Vsevolod Klementjev (KleMiX) released
    <a href="https://www.klemix.com/page/iTileMaps.aspx">iTileMaps</a> for iPad.
    Since quite a few of Tiled users are developing for iOS, this will be of
    interest to some of you.
</p>
<p>
    iTileMaps allows you to view and edit your tile maps on your iPad. Even
    though it's just the initial release, it already supports most features of
    the
    <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/TMX-Map-Format"
        >TMX map format</a
    >, including editing of object layers and properties (see its website for a
    list of features as well as current limitations).
</p>
<p>
    The developer allowed me to try it out, and the main thing I noticed is that
    it runs very smooth. Also the interface looks pretty good. It's certainly
    not more efficient than editing the maps in Tiled (yet), but I think it has
    a good potential once there has been more time to learn what works and what
    doesn't for a touch based tile map editor.
</p>
<p>
    If you find this interesting, don't hesitate to support KleMiX by
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/itilemaps/id432784227"
        >getting your copy</a
    >. He's also very open to feedback (just like me), so let him know how you
    think he could improve iTileMaps!
