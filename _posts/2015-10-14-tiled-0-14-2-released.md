Since [Tiled 0.14.1][1], a Polish translation was added and the Brazilian Portuguese translation was revived by a new translator (after not getting updated since Tiled 0.9). Apart from that, several small issues were reported that I wanted to fix sooner rather than later.

Here's the full changelog:

* [#1101](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/issues/1101) - Fixed layer offsets missing in the Lua export
* [#1108](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/issues/1108) - Fixed JSON tileset format missing in 'Add External Tileset' action
* [#1119](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/issues/1119) - Fixed language selection entries for Portuguese
* [#1113](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/issues/1113) - Fixed an issue with copy/pasting when using image collection tilesets
* [#1086](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/pull/1086) - Added Polish translation (by Tomasz Kubiak)
* [#1112](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/pull/1112) - Updated Brazilian Portuguese translation (by Laete Meireles)

You can find the latest version on the [Download page][3].

In the meantime I'm making progress on Tiled 1.0 relevant issues. You can follow the progress in the [weekly development updates][2] (grouped by month), of which a new one should come out soon.
