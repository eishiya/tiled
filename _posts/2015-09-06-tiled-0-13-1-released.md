So far [Tiled 0.13][1] seems to have been a pretty stable release, since I didn't find a reason to patch up any critical issues yet. But, there's still reason for a patch release to include several translation updates.

Here's the changelog:

* Added Bulgarian translation (by Lyubomir Vasilev)
* Updated Spanish, French and Dutch translations (by Mauricio Muñoz Lucero, Yohann Ferreira and myself)
* Windows binary now built against Qt 5.5

Meanwhile I've been making good progress towards Tiled 0.14, which will bring some nice features like external tilesets in JSON format, a per-layer offset in pixels and the return of the object name labels. This would not be possible without the [generous support from my patrons][2]. Thanks!
