    Tiled <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/download">daily builds</a> have been
    available since a while for Windows, Ubuntu, Fedora and several other
    GNU/Linux distributions. Now there are daily builds available for Mac OS X
    as well!
</p>
<p>
    These builds have been made possible by Steffen Itterheim from
    <a href="http://koboldkit.com/">Kobold Kit</a>, who sent me his Mac mini
    with a fresh install of Mac OS X 10.8. In addition he also offered to host
    the builds on his server. A huge thanks to Steffen for this amazing
    contribution!
</p>
<p>
    Having access to a Mac of course has some other advantages as well. New
    releases will now always be available for OS X immediately, while before it
    would usually take a few days. Also, I should now be able to reproduce (and
    hopefully fix) issues that only happen on OS X.
</p>
<p>
    If you're a Mac OS X user who enjoys making maps with Tiled, be sure to
    check out Steffen's
    <a href="http://www.koboldtouch.com/">Kobold Touch</a> and
    <a href="http://koboldkit.com/">Kobold Kit</a> game engines. They integrate
    very well with Tiled and add new features based on custom properties like
    parallax scrolling and physics, and should be a quick way to get a headstart
    on your game.
