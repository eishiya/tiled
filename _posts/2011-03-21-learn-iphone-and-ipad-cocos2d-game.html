    focuses on iPhone/iPad game development using the
    <a href="http://www.cocos2d.org/">cocos2d-iphone</a> library. However, it
    includes <i>two full chapters</i> about using tile maps and how to create
    them with Tiled, the second going in detail about isometric maps.

<p>
    Since cocos2d-iphone has built-in support for the
    <a href="https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/tmx-map-format/"
        >TMX map format</a
    >, the map parsing business is skipped and instead the book talks about how
    to use Tiled and the cocos2d-iphone API to get the map on the screen and how
    to obtain information from your map. This includes things like setting up
    your OpenGL projection matrix, scrolling the map, getting your player to
    walk behind tiles and finding out whether a tile collides with the player.

    Again I had the pleasure to review these chapters before the book was
    published, and I can wholly recommend it. The problems that are discussed
    are things that most game developers will encounter eventually, and the
    solutions are nice and well explained.

        thanks! Also, I read from the reviews that the eBook version is in bad
        shape, so better get the paper version.</i
