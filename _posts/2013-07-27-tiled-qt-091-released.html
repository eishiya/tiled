<p>
    This is mostly a bug fixing release, adding only some minor things here and
    there. Notable changes include making sure the JSON format stores
    everything, fixing string quoting issues in the Lua export and allowing
    double-click on objects to open their properties dialog. And for those who
    like to have a lot of maps open at the same time, Tiled should now close a
    lot faster. Here's the full list of changes:

    Meanwhile, a lot of new features have already been added for the next
    feature release of Tiled. I have described some of them in the first
    <a
        href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-04-26-tiled-development-update %}"
        >Tiled development update</a
    >
    and I plan to blog about some other new stuff soon. Don't be afraid to try a
    <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/download.html">daily build</a>! Apart from
    being able to try the new features, it is also your chance of providing
    feedback before they enter a stable release.
