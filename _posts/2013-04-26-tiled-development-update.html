<p>
    It's been a while since the 0.9 release and meanwhile several new features
    have been added and are already available in the daily builds which are
    worth mentioning.
</p>
<h2>Object Flipping and Rotation</h2>
<p>
    First of all it is now possible to flip objects horizontally and vertically.
    This works on both tile objects as well as polygons, using the same keys as
    for flipping tiles (X and Y). Second, all object types now feature free 360
    degree rotation. Work on these features was sponsored by Ben Wales, who is
    making his maps primarily by placing tile images.
</p>
<p>
    I started the rotation support by accepting
    <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/pull/168">pull request #168</a>,
    which associated an angle with each object. I then changed the behavior so
    that instead of drawing an arrow, the objects were rotated. The most
    time-consuming part was to make it possible to interactively rotate objects,
    but it was worth it. It's possible to rotate objects either individually or
    as a group using handles placed at the corners, modeled after Inkscape
    behavior. You can also hold <code>Control</code> for changing the rotation
    in increments of 15 degrees.
</p>

    /></a>
</p>
<p>
    One point of discussion was where the rotation origin should be. I tried
    both rotating objects around their position as well as rotating them around
    their visual center. The latter seemed more intuitive when changing the
    rotation value by hand, however it caused problems in other cases. The
    visual center changes for example while resizing an object or when adjusting
    points on a polygon, which in turn caused rotated objects to shift around
    while doing such operations. In the end I settled for rotating objects
    around their position.
</p>
<h2>Docked Properties Editor</h2>
<p>
    Another major new feature, which had been a long-time goal since years, has
    recently been triggered by a donation from Victor Chelaru (known for
    <a href="https://flatredball.com/">FlatRedBall</a>). Until now the
    "Properties" dialog in Tiled was an unloved feature. While being the
    cornerstone for Tiled's flexibility, its user experience was quite bad as
    modal dialog and its simple table view was behaving strange in some cases
    and wasn't very intuitive.
</p>
<p>
    This all changed now with the new Properties dock! You can leave it open and
    it will immediately display the properties of whatever you're clicking on.
    Also, it displays both built-in as well as custom properties in a single
    unified tree view, based on the
    <a
        href="https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt-solutions/qt-solutions.git/tree/qtpropertybrowser"
        >Qt Property Browser</a
    >
    solution.
</p>

    <a
        href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MYj7AQUjDYc/UXpsRbw66cI/AAAAAAAAE7U/UwWVarOd4vk/s1600/tiled-docked-properties.png"

    /></a>
</p>
<p>
    Its unified structure also opens the way for allowing more existing built-in
    properties to be edited as well as to define types on custom properties
    (some work has been done on that by Christian Ivicevic at
    <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/issues/365">issue #365</a>).
</p>
<h2>Writing Import/Export Scripts in Python</h2>
<p>
    Thanks to a major effort by Samuli Tuomola, a new Tiled plugin adds support
    for writing import and export scripts in Python. For some people this
    greatly simplifies the task of adding support for certain map formats to
    Tiled. As an example Samuli has added read &amp; write support for maps
    created in <a href="https://www.tilemap.co.uk/mappy.php">Mappy</a> as well
    as support for editing maps from the game
    <a href="https://www.pistegamez.net/game_pk2.html">Pekka Kana&nbsp;2</a>.
    More information is available at the
    <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/pull/415">pull request</a>.
</p>
<h2>Feedback Welcome</h2>
<p>
    If you're interested in trying any of these features, please install a
    <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/download.html">daily build</a> or compile
    Tiled from the <code>master</code> branch. Your feedback is welcome and will
    help polishing up Tiled for the next feature release!
</p>
<p>
    Finally, if you enjoy using Tiled and would like to help speeding up its
    development in general, please consider making a small weekly donation
    through <a href="https://www.gittip.com/bjorn/">gittip</a>. When just 100
    Tiled users would tip an average of $2.50 a week, this would allow me to
    spend a full day a week on moving Tiled forward!
