<p>
    The past month I've been working on a
    <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/">new website</a> for Tiled. The new site
    communicates better what the main features of Tiled are and improves the
    visibility of links to related pages and available download options. I also
    hope you agree it looks a lot better!

    /></a>

    An important change I made is to make the option to donate more obvious. My
    spare time has been very limited since my daughter was born, which will get
    even worse when the paternity leave runs out (which currently allows me to
    work part-time for a few months). So, my plan is that when enough people
    donate to Tiled regularly, I will switch my current full time job to
    part-time permanently, and spend the freed up time on Tiled instead.
</p>
<p>
    This means the donations will no longer be only a motivation for me to work
    on Tiled (which can be frustrating when I don't actually have the time), but
    they will contribute directly to the amount of time I will be able to spend
    on further Tiled development. The more that comes in, the less I will depend
    on my current job so the more time I will have for Tiled. I found the most
    suitable service for this is
    <a href="https://www.gittip.com/bjorn">Gittip</a>, which allows anybody to
    start or stop contributing at any time and does not charge additional fees.
    Other options and a rough future roadmap are provided on the
    <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/donate.html">Donate</a> page.
</p>
<p>
    With the new homepage, this blog is now a little more in the background.
    However, I plan to use it more actively so instead of only announcing the
    new releases I can write a little about new features when they are done for
    example, or highlight projects related to Tiled. Something in between what
    the blog was until now and the Google+ page (where of course new blog posts
    will also be shared).
</p>
<p>
    I'm excited about this new period in Tiled's development. I hope you are
    too!
