<p>
    Please welcome the first community supported Tiled release! The main new
    feature in this release is the improved support for object resizing,
    including support for resizing polygons and tile objects. The time I needed
    to finalize the integration of this
    <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/pull/593">pull request</a> and doing
    subsequent polishing was sponsored directly by
    <a href="https://www.patreon.com/bjorn?ty=p">my patrons</a>. I want to thank
    them all for their invaluable contributions! If you're using Tiled and want
    to help me spend more time on improving it, please consider
    <a href="https://www.patreon.com/bjorn">becoming a patron</a>. Even a small
    amount is very appreciated!
