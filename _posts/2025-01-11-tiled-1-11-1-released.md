Apart from fixing a number of issues in [Tiled 1.11][tiled-1.11], this release
adds support for loading Aseprite images, brings a few scripting API additions
as well as a small AutoMapping improvement.

### Aseprite Image Support

Tiled now supports loading [Aseprite](https://aseprite.org/) images directly.
Aseprite is a popular editor for pixel art. This means you can now use `.ase` /
`.aseprite` files in your tilesets, without needing to export them to PNG or
other common formats first.

This is made possible by [qaseprite](https://github.com/mapeditor/qaseprite), a
new Qt image format plugin that loads Aseprite images based on the libraries
provided by the Aseprite project.

Of course exporting your images may still be necessary for your game engine or
other tools, but in some cases even that can be avoided, for example using
[MonoGame.Aseprite](https://github.com/AristurtleDev/monogame-aseprite), [Unity
aseprite-importer](https://github.com/negi0109/unity-aseprite-importer) or
[Godot Aseprite Wizard](https://github.com/viniciusgerevini/godot-aseprite-wizard).
For now it remains to be seen how such importers can be used alongside the
various Tiled support libraries for these frameworks.

### AutoMapping Improvement

The [AutoMapping feature](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/manual/automapping/)
now ignores rules with empty input or output regions. This is especially useful
while setting up rules, since incomplete rules that did not have their inputs
defined yet would previously cause the output to be applied everywhere at an
offset.
