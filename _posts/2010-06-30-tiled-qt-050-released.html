<p>
    At long last I managed to finish another release, with the main aim to add
    the last glaring missing features compared to the old Java version. This
    included mostly tileset management, and support for input/output plugins.
</p>
<p>
    There have also been some new contributors. Andrew G. Crowell made the layer
    actions accessible via a right-click menu and in a small toolbar. Michael
    Woerister enhanced the object properties dialog with additional fields to
    change the position and size. Finally, Janis Kirsteins added a Latvian
    translation. Thanks! Also thanks to all the existing translators who have
    updated their translation to the new release! The full list of changes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Added support for import and export plugins</li>
    <li>Added support for external tilesets</li>
    <li>Added undo for adding tilesets and ability to remove tilesets</li>
    <li>Added error handling to the New Tileset dialog</li>
    <li>Added ability to change tileset order by dragging them around</li>
    <li>Added option to draw the tile grid when saving as image</li>
    <li>Added a context menu and tool buttons to the layer dock</li>
    <li>Added Latvian translation</li>
    <li>Added an install target to the Makefile</li>
    <li>Open local files when they are dropped onto Tiled</li>
    <li>
        Allow changing position and size of objects in the Object Properties
        dialog
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed rendering issues with tiles wider than the tile width of the map
    </li>
    <li>Fixed eraser and fill tool working on invisible layers</li>
    <li>Fixed a crash when using some tools when no map is loaded</li>
    <li>Fixed compile errors related to detecting static builds</li>
    <li>Fixed the Save dialog not suggesting any particular file extension</li>
    <li>
        Updated Japanese, Dutch, German, Brazilian Portuguese, French,
        Portuguese and Spanish translations
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    As needed to allow plugins, part of Tiled is now in a small shared library.
    In the future I intend to also move the map reader and renderer into this
    library so that it can be re-used by games implemented using Qt. I'm also
    adding a Java version of this library.
</p>
