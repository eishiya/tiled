<p>
    After a long pause, there's finally a new release of Tiled. We also released
    two tutorials on the website. Changes include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Configuration defaults to preset values, Tiled should now work fine if
        there is no initial config file
    </li>
    <li>Layer rotation and flipping</li>
    <li>Map resizing (warning: cannot be undone yet)</li>
    <li>Custom properties on tiles and map</li>
    <li>A file filter on loading and saving for .tmx and .tsx</li>
    <li>
        Several UI improvements (usage of JSplitPane and JSpinner for example)
    </li>
    <li>Small changes to the map format*</li>
    <li>Implemented a better underlying architecture for Maps and Brushes</li>
    <li>Fixed several null pointer exceptions</li>
    <li>
        Added an Ant build target for tiled-core.jar, for use in Java engines
    </li>
    <li>
        Support for other than 2:1 isometric tile ratios (2:1 and 1:1 tested)
    </li>
    <li>Fixed redo for painting operations (paint, fill, erase)</li>
    <li>Improved undo/redo of layer organisation changes</li>
</ul>
<p>
    *) Map width/height are now attributes of the map element instead of a
    seperate dimensions element. Also, Tiled now correctly wraps unencoded layer
    data in a data element.
</p>
