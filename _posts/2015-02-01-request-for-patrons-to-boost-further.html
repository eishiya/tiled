<p>
    Increasingly, just responding to Tiled feature requests and usage questions
    is taking so much of my time that it leaves barely any time for working on
    new features. Not only has the pace of incoming requests increased, but my
    spare time is also still getting smaller with my daughter growing up and a
    second child on the way. As nice as it is to grow a family, not having time
    to make often requested improvements to Tiled is also frustrating.
</p>
<p>
    I want to fix this, but I can't do it by sacrificing my weekend or by
    working in the evenings. Instead, I'll need to give up part of my full time
    job. I'm asking for your support in making this possible, with monthly
    donations to offset the otherwise lost income. I've chosen
    <a href="https://www.patreon.com/bjorn">Patreon</a> as the platform for
    this.
</p>
<p>
    Tiled is free software and any improvements will be available to everybody,
    but the rewards on Patreon are only available to patrons so check them out!
    Suggestions for other rewards are also welcome.
</p>
<p>
    Apart from the rewards there are Milestone Goals. These clearly communicate
    several milestones of support and what I would be able to give back in
    return. Each amount includes German income taxes of about 35%.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>$500 per month</b> - This milestone, in addition to existing income
        from advertising sponsors, allows me to work one full day a week on
        Tiled.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>$1500 per month</b> - This milestone allows me to work two full days
        a week on Tiled.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>$5000 per month</b> - When support for Tiled reaches this level, I'll
        commit to it full time. Apart from improving Tiled I'll also have time
        to work on other interesting free tools.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The above list is just the initial milestone setup. There are more ways to
    spend money than living from it, but staying alive is a good start.
</p>
<p>
    So
    <i
        >please consider
        <a href="https://www.patreon.com/bjorn"
            >supporting Tiled as my patron</a
        ></i
    >, even if it's just a little! With the many users of Tiled worldwide, the
    goal should be anything but unrealistic as long as everybody adds something.
</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your support!</p>
