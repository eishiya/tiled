    Another small bugfix release, fixing a potential crash and a host of smaller
    issues. The changelog:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Fixed hit area for polygon nodes when editing polygons while zoomed in
        or out
    </li>
    <li>Fixed another possible crash in the orthogonal renderer</li>
    <li>Fixed Select All action to work for object layers</li>
    <li>Fixed map pixel size preview for staggered maps</li>
    <li>
        Fixed repainting issues when tiles extend beyond their layer boundaries
    </li>
    <li>Fixed repainting issues when using tiles smaller than the grid size</li>
    <li>Display errors non-modal when applying automatic automapping rules</li>
    <li>
        Flare plugin: Fixed coordinate format for import and export (by Justin
        Jacobs)
    </li>
    <li>Lua plugin: Write out Image layer position</li>
    <li>Small updates to the Italian translation (by Omnomnobot)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Meanwhile, I'm making progress on adding support for
    <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/issues/1">hexagonal maps</a> and
    plan to release Tiled 0.11 as soon as this is complete. You can already try
    the support for "pointy topped" staggered hexagonal maps in the daily
    builds!
</p>
<p>
    Finally, there is now a
    <a href="https://discourse.mapeditor.org/">Tiled community forum</a>. I plan
    to post weekly development updates there and of course any other
    Tiled-related topics are welcome there too!
