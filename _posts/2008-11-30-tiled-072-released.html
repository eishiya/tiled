<p>
    Since a stable release of 0.8.0 could still take a while, I've decided to
    make another release with some fixes made since 0.7.1. The changes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Added support for associating an image with a map object</li>
    <li>Fixed not being able to move an object group</li>
    <li>Fixed unable to select small map objects (by Jared Adams)</li>
    <li>
        Fixed references to external tilesets that are not in the same directory
    </li>
    <li>Fixed some files missing from tiled-core.jar (by Jared Adams)</li>
    <li>
        Updated The Mana World plugin to detect the collision layer correctly
        (by Jared Adams)
    </li>
    <li>Updated minimum Java version to 1.5</li>
</ul>
