<p>
    Shortly after we released Tiled 0.7.0, a number of issues were found. Some
    of them were pretty critical or meant basic functionality was broken, so I
    decided not to wait too long with making a new release. The changes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Added support for a margin around a tileset image</li>
    <li>
        Improved the tileset manager and allow tileset reorganizing (by Jared
        Adams)
    </li>
    <li>Fixed automatically adding extension to tileset Save As... dialog</li>
    <li>Fixed saving/loading of layers with an origin other than 0,0</li>
    <li>
        Fixed map resize to apply the offset to layers not matching the map
        bounds
    </li>
    <li>Fixed loading of object group properties</li>
    <li>Fixed duplicates of object groups to not share the objects</li>
    <li>
        Fixed Lua export to increase firstgid of tilesets properly (by Jelle
        Geerts)
    </li>
    <li>Fixed saving of property values that contain quotes</li>
    <li>Fixed the state of menu actions when starting up without a map</li>
</ul>
