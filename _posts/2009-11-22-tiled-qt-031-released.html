>A few issues with the 0.3.0 release got reported, and this release is mostly
about fixing those up. The list of changes:<br />
<ul>
    <li>Enabled undo command compression for stamp brush and eraser</li>
    <li>Fixed reading of maps with non-binary-encoded layer data</li>
    <li>Fixed a compile issue on Mac OS X related to QXmlStreamWriter</li>
    <li>Fixed a crash when loading a map while holding Ctrl</li>
    <li>Confirm overwrite on the right moment for 'Save as Image' dialog</li>
</ul>
For the next release I'm working on support for isometric maps. Hopefully there
will even be time to include support for hexagonal maps as well. Stay tuned!
