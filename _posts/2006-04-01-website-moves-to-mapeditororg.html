    We've registered our own domain and moved our website from
    <a href="https://tiled.rpgdx.net/">https://tiled.rpgdx.net/</a> to our new
    location at <a href="https://mapeditor.org/">https://mapeditor.org/</a>. Be
    sure to update your bookmarks! ;-)

    Recently there has been some progress towards a new Tiled release, which is
    expected to be released within a few weeks. Improvements will include
    bugfixes and internationalization. We also hope to include some new
    features, but unfortunately we are still rather short on time. Note that if
    you are using Tiled and would like to work on some improvements, do not
    hesitate to contact us.
