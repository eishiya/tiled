<p>
    This release fixes a few minor bugs reported by users. Since it didn't seem
    likely that much more fixes would accumulate, it was time to get them out
    there. The changes are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed object layers losing their color when resizing the map</li>
    <li>
        Fixed the tabs in the Tilesets dock to use scroll buttons on MacOS X
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed window title to update when saving a map with a different name
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The 0.7.0 release is expected to be still quite a bit off, but meanwhile you
    can already compile Tiled yourself from the git master branch to try out
    some of the new features. These include merging layers, copy & paste support
    for objects and various improvements to the support for running external
    commands. Maybe you could even try adding your own favorite feature to the
    list!
