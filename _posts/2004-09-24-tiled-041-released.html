<p>
    This release brings some stability and usability improvements, along with a
    few new features that are still a bit experimental like selections,
    search/replace and hexagonal maps.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Added search/replace functionality</li>
    <li>Added tooltips to buttons</li>
    <li>Added map save/load plugin support</li>
    <li>Added marquee selections</li>
    <li>Added HexMapView, contributed by Andreas Mross (experimental)</li>
    <li>
        Removed name and version attributes from map, custom properties suffice
        there
    </li>
    <li>Removed name attribute from tile for same reason</li>
    <li>More intelligent starting locations for file choosers</li>
    <li>Grid display is now configurable (opacity, antialiasing)</li>
    <li>Fixes to tileset editing dialog</li>
    <li>Fixed config file saving to stop adding newlines to the config file</li>
    <li>Fixed window close button to behave the same as File->Exit</li>
    <li>Fixed undo/redo for moving layers</li>
    <li>Fixed moving a duplicated layer to no longer move original too</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Thanks go to Ahmed Mohombe and Andreas Mross for their feedback and
    suggestions! Andreas also contributed code for hexagonal maps, expect
    improvements to this new map view in later versions.
