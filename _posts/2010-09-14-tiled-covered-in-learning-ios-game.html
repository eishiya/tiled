    />. The cool thing about this book, aside from showing you how to make a
    game start to end, is that it covers how to use Tiled to create your maps
    and how to use the created maps in your game.

    I've personally had the pleasure of reviewing the Tile Maps chapter in
    Michael's book. While I couldn't look too deep into the code (I'm not
    familiar with Objective-C), I can say that apart from showing how to use
    Tiled, it goes into detail about how to parse Tiled's XML based map format
    and how to render it using OpenGL.
