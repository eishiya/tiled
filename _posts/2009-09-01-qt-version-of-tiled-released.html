>Things have been pretty quiet since the 0.7.2 release of Tiled. This was partly
due to me working on a rewrite of Tiled, using Qt/C++. I now think this rewrite
is complete enough for its first release, though compared to the Java version a
lot of features are still missing. You'll find Tiled Qt 0.1.0 on in the
Development section of the&nbsp;<a

    >downloads page</a
>.<br /><br />I'm curious to hear how the Qt version works for you, and am
looking forward to hear about everyones favourite missing feature. A&nbsp;<a

    >new bug tracker</a
>&nbsp;has been set up to keep track of your feedback. As always, feel free to
email me directly or to write to the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://rpgdx.net/mailman/listinfo/tiled-user_rpgdx.net"
    >tiled-user mailing list</a
>.<br /><br />Finally, I'm looking for additional contributors! Are you familiar
with C++ and Qt, or want to learn? Tiled is a relatively small and simple
project, with a clean design. Any help is appreciated! :-)
