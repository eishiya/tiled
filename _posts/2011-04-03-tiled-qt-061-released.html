<p>
    I'm happy to announce the immediate availability of the 0.6.1 bugfix
    release! Quite a few fixes have accumulated since the last release, so it
    was about time to get them out there.
</p>
<p>
    Of special note is that from this release on, there will be a Windows
    installer rather than a zip archive, thanks to Mohammad Mehdi Salem Naraghi.
    Since this is the first release with a Windows installer, there may still be
    issues. It should make installing Tiled on Windows quite a bit more
    pleasant.
</p>
<p>
    Many fixes were made to the automatic mapping feature by Stefan Beller. Petr
    Viktorin and Ben Longbons allowed Tiled to open multiple files at once. The
    full list of changes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Added ability to open multiple files at once through the file dialog and
        command line
    </li>
    <li>Added Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown shortcuts to switch documents</li>
    <li>Added an example to show how automatic mapping works</li>
    <li>Fixed bugs, crashes and leaks in the automatic mapping feature</li>
    <li>Fixed starting point for circles to be the click position</li>
    <li>Fixed a memory leak when using lines or circles</li>
    <li>Fixed layer opacity to be taken into account when saving as image</li>
    <li>Fixed endless loop when tile size is set to 0</li>
    <li>Fixed crash when passing an empty string as command line parameter</li>
    <li>Fixed problems with the tileset view after switching documents</li>
    <li>Fixed tile objects to be removed when their tileset is removed</li>
</ul>
