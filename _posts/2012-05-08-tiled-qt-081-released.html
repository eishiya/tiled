<p>
    The 0.8 branch had slowly been accumilating fixes and translation updates
    that made it worth to release Tiled Qt 0.8.1. Upgrading is highly
    recommended since there was a crash related to pasting. Also noteworthy is
    the improved support for mice with fine-resolution wheels like the Magic
    Mouse. Thanks to all who contributed, and also thanks to Jeff Bland for
    updating the Mac release!
