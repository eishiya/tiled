<p>
    After a two week testing period, the official source code repository has
    been switched over from Subversion to
    <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a>. This version
    control system is not much more complicated than Subversion, while offering
    a lot of advantages. If you've been following Tiled development using
    Subversion and have questions about
    <a href="http://hg.mapeditor.org/tiled">the new repository</a>, feel free to
    contact us!
