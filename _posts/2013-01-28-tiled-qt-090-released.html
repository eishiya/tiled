<p>
    At long last there is a new feature release of Tiled! Ever since 0.8 was
    released new features have kept accumulating at pretty much the usual pace,
    so there is a lot of new stuff in this one. It's hard to pick favourites, so
    I'll only highlight a couple.
</p>
<p>
    Several new dockable windows have been added. There's now a file system
    view, an object list and a mini-map. These should really help navigating
    your ever growing world.
</p>
<p>
    Also, many improvements have been made to the
    <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/Automapping">automapping</a>
    system, which can now produce object layers and apply rules while editing.
    New in this area is the
    <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/Using-the-Terrain-Tool"
        >terrain tool</a
    >, which really helps if its corner-based algorithm works with your tiles.
