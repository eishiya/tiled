<p>
    Thanks to the efforts of Erik Schilling, there are once again updated Tiled
    packages available for all recent versions of Ubuntu (or derivatives like
    Mint). Not only this, but the
    <a href="https://launchpad.net/~mapeditor.org/+archive/tiled"
        >new official PPA</a
    >
    also contains a <code>tiled-daily</code> package that is updated whenever
    changes are pushed into the repository.
</p>
<p>
    Actually
    <a href="https://files.mapeditor.org/daily/">daily builds for Windows</a>
    have been available since a long time, thanks to Stefan Beller. I've now
    added a link to these to the sidebar as well.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to see what's new in the daily builds, keep an eye on the
    <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/commits/master">commit log</a> of
    the master branch, on which these builds are based.
